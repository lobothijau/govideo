## Go Video

This is a simple web application that allows users to browse Go-related videos from across the internet. Users can view videos organized by events or find specific content through the search bar. The application includes features such as watchlists, a like mechanism, and a comment system.

## Why I built this web app

I created this web application to practice web development using the Go programming language and to build something both useful and enjoyable (while also helping me land a Go developer position ðŸ˜‰).

Since the main purpose of this project is learning (and eventually securing a job), I've included some features that might seem redundant. For example, the comment and upvote systems may not be strictly necessary since most videos are hosted on YouTube, which already provides these features.

The main inspiration for this project comes from [Ruby Video](https://www.rubyvideo.dev/) and [PyVideo](https://pyvideo.org/).
