## Go Video

This is a simple Go web application to allows users to browse Go related videos on the internet, view them by events or simply search for them through the search bar. It would have something like watchlist, a like mechanism, and a comment system.

## Why I build this web app

I build this web app because I want to implement what I learn about web development using Go programming language and I want to build something that is useful and fun to use (and to help me get a Go job ðŸ˜‰).

Since the main purpose of this web app to help me learn (and eventually get a job), I will try to add features that might be not very useful. For example, a comment system or upvote system might not necessary since most of the videos are on YouTube and have its own comment and upvote system. 

The main inspiration of this web app is [Ruby Video](https://www.rubyvideo.dev/) and [PyVideo](https://pyvideo.org/).
